## Executive Summary

- DEMO ONLY: this bundle is a synthetic showcase for reporting, storytelling, and dashboard flow, not the real experiment conclusion.
- The strict synthetic track keeps the baseline positive but modest, then layers believable improvements across LSTM, GRU, and TransformerEncoder.
- The exploratory synthetic track is intentionally more active and higher return, but it accepts visibly higher drawdown and rougher path behavior.

**Verdict:** The current artifact set contains a positive post-cost out-of-sample strategy under the configured assumptions.

### Core Assumptions

- DEMO ONLY: all returns, reports, and charts in this branch are synthetic illustrative results for presentation only.
- Strict showcase metrics are designed to look plausible, non-monotonic, and internally consistent rather than to reproduce the real experiment.
- Exploratory showcase metrics intentionally target a more active opportunity set, higher trade counts, and visibly higher drawdown.
- Primary leaderboards are test-split views; combined tables remain supplementary context.
- Backtest curves are sampled on business days for presentation readability while the surrounding market narrative remains aligned with the hourly BTCUSDT setup.
- Fees, slippage, and funding contribution fields are synthetic but sized to stay within credible delta-neutral prototype ranges.

## Robustness Interpretation

| Family | Representative Strategy | Trades | Cum Return | Sharpe | Net PnL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Deep Learning | transformer_encoder | 97 | 10.20% | 1.584 | $10,199.99 |
| Rule-Based Baseline | spread_zscore_1p5 | 94 | 2.40% | 0.440 | $2,400.04 |
| Simple ML Baseline | elastic_net_regression | 126 | 4.10% | 0.731 | $4,100.05 |


## Exploratory DL Showcase

Exploratory DL results are supplementary showcase results designed to demonstrate model learning behavior, ranking ability, and alternative opportunity definitions. They do not replace the strict post-cost primary conclusion.

| Strategy | Model | Target | Signal Rule | Split | Trades | Cum Return | MTM Sharpe | Net PnL | Status | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| transformer_direction__rolling_top_decile_abs | transformer_encoder | direction_classification | rolling_top_decile_abs | test | 247 | 15.80% | 1.560 | $15,799.76 | completed |  |


## Vault Prototype

- Selected strategy: `transformer_encoder`
- Strategy state: `active`
- Suggested direction: `short_perp_long_spot`
- Reported NAV assets: `110,199,990,715`
- Summary PnL: `$10,199.99`
- Prepared contract calls: `2`

## Contributions

- One-command synthetic showcase generation now rebuilds coherent CSV, parquet, JSON, markdown, HTML, and chart artifacts from a single internal scenario.
- The showcase stays fully isolated from the real experiment directories and leaves the default research pipeline untouched.
- The frontend can now switch to a separate demo bundle through a query parameter without replacing the default dashboard data.

## Limitations

- DEMO ONLY results are illustrative and should not be interpreted as the repository's real empirical finding.
- Synthetic strategy curves are sampled for presentation readability and are engineered to look plausible rather than to replay actual execution history.
- The synthetic showcase remains single-market and narrative-focused so it stays lightweight enough for a course-project demo workflow.

## Future Work

- Extend the isolated showcase system to support multiple preset narrative packs for different presentation contexts.
- Add a lightweight frontend bundle switcher so reviewers can toggle between real and synthetic artifact sets without editing URLs.

### DEMO ONLY | Strict drawdown comparison

Synthetic illustrative results: every strict strategy carries non-zero drawdown and staged recovery rather than monotonic ascent.

### DEMO ONLY | Strict monthly returns

Synthetic illustrative results: monthly performance rotates between soft patches, recovery legs, and quieter consolidation windows.
